DNS PRIVate Exchange
--------------------

The DNS PRIVate Exchange (DPRIVE) Working Group develops mechanisms 
to add provide confidentiality to DNS transactions, to address
pervasive monitoring attack (RFC 7258) concerns.

The set of DNS requests that requests an individual makes provides an
attacker with a large amount of information about that individual. DPRIVE
aims to deprive the attacker of this information.

The primary focus will be on mechanisms that provide confidentialiy between
clients & iterative resolvers, but may also consider mechanisms that provide
confidentiality between iterative resolvers & authoritative servers, or that
provide end-to-end confidentiality. 

DPRIVE is only chartered to work on mechanisms that add confidentiality
to the DNS. While it may be tempting to solve a bunch of other DNS issues
while adding confidentiality, DPRIVE is not the working group to do this. 

The DPRIVE WG will focus on a solution that addresses risks such as those in
draft-bortzmeyer-dnsop-privacy.

Some of the main design goals (in no particular order) are:

- Provide confidentiality to DNS transactions.

- Maintain backwards compatibility with legacy DNS implementations

- Require no application-level changes

- Require no additional information from applications or users

- Focus on developing a deployable solution!
