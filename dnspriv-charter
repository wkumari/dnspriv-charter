DNS PRIVate Exchange
--------------------

The DNS PRIVate Exchange (DPRIVE) will develop mechanisms to provide
confidentiality to DNS exchanges. The WG will specify mechanisms that
extend the DNS protocol to ensure communication between clients & resolvers
and resolvers & authoritative servers are confidential and maintains
message integrity.

The goal of this WG is to provide privacy to all DNS message exchanges,
primarily to address the threats of pervasive monitoring (RFC 7258). The
DPRIVE WG will focus on a solution that addresses the risks described in
draft-bortzmeyer-dnsop-privacy. The goals of the DPRIVE WG are:

- Provide privacy and message integrity for all DNS transactions

- Maintain backwards compatibility with legacy DNS implementations

- Require no application-level changes

- Require no additional information from applications or users

The WG will deliver:

- A protocol specification for DNS exchange privacy and message integrity

- Key exchange mechanism?
